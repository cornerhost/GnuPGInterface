	* GnuPGInterface.py, NEWS:     *   MAJOR BACKWARDS COMPATIBLITY
	BREAK:
		Major API changes with regards to GnuPGInterface's run()
		method have been made. A much cleaner and more sensible
		method is now used to request which filehandles are
	'created'
		and which are 'attached'.  See the documentation and
	example
		code for details.
	
	    *	The ability to have run() 'attach' GnuPG filehandles
		to already-opened files works now. Really, it does :)
		(I implemented more doctest tests to make sure now).

	* GnuPGInterface.py: We used to test if h was a FileType, but this
	destroys abstraction, such as if there is a FileType-like object
	which merely implements everything we need.  So now, we test for if
	h has the value 1, and only if so do we 'generate' a filehandle for
	it.  If h is false, then we will disregard it
